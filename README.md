# Othello-AI

This is an AI that can play the board game Othello. I made it while learning about an algorithm called minimax, which considers future moves in order to play perfect information games. The jar file for the AI can be downloaded at https://github.com/Quillbert/Othello-AI/releases/download/Release/Othello-AI.jar. It will allow a user to play against the AI, which will think six moves ahead.
